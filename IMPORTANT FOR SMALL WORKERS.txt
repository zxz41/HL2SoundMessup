Whenever you wish to add a new sound, please concider adding it thru soundscript rather than replacing sounds

e.g. "sound\custom\plats\elevbell1.wav" and replacing the corresponding line of soundscript code to it
You should only replace the file if you want to be 100% sure it replaces all instances of that sound.

Please don't use enormous huge files.
Don't replace "important" dialog for now.
